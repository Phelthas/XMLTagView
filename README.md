# XMLTagView

A tagView for displaying tags, tag with multiple lines supported, using PureLayout 

XMLTagView is a subClass of UIview to show tag buttons with mutipule lines, it is just like a tableView and all you have to do 
is to implement it's delegate method. It will look like this:

I am inspired by [SKTagView of @zsk425](https://github.com/zsk425/SKTagView) <br>
and it is based on [PureLayout by smileyborg](https://github.com/smileyborg/PureLayout)

Actually I think it is better to do this With UICollectionView, but if there are not so many tags XMLTagView is also a good choice.

## How to use
add XMLTagView.h and XMLTagView.m to your project <br>
The rest is just like a UITableView and you could see it in the demo

## Requirements
targeting either iOS 6.0 and above, ARC-enabled.
