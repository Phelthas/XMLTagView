# XMLTagView
A tagView for displaying tags, tag with multiple lines supported, using PureLayout 


XMLTagView is a subClass of UIview to show tag buttons with mutipule lines, it is just like a tableView and all you have to do 
is to implement it's delegate method. It will look like this:



I am inspired by SKTagView of @zsk425
and it is based on PureLayout by smileyborg

Actually I think it is better to do this With UICollectionView, but if there are not so many tags XMLTagView is also a good choice.
